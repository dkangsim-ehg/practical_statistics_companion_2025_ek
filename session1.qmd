## Understanding Variables and Measurement Scales

In biostatistics and medical research, understanding the type of data you're working with is crucial for choosing appropriate analytical methods.

### Types of Variables in Medical Research

```{webr-r}
# Display our medical research dataset
cat("Sample Medical Research Dataset:\n")
print(head(diet_data, 8))
```

### Visualizing Variable Types

```{webr-r}
# Nominal variable: Treatment group distribution
treatment_plot <- measurement_demo %>%
  count(treatment_group) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = treatment_group, y = n, fill = treatment_group)) +
  geom_col(alpha = 0.8) +
  labs(title = "Treatment Group Distribution (Nominal Variable)",
       x = "Treatment Group", y = "Count") +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

print(treatment_plot)
```

```{webr-r}
# Ordinal variable: Pain rating
pain_plot <- measurement_demo %>%
  count(pain_rating) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(pain_rating), y = n, fill = factor(pain_rating))) +
  geom_col(alpha = 0.8) +
  labs(title = "Pain Rating Distribution (Ordinal Variable)",
       subtitle = "1 = No pain, 10 = Severe pain",
       x = "Pain Rating", y = "Count") +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

print(pain_plot)
```

```{webr-r}
# Continuous variable: Weight distribution
weight_plot <- measurement_demo %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = weight_kg)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "steelblue", alpha = 0.8, color = "white") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(weight_kg)), 
             color = "red", linetype = "dashed", linewidth = 1) +
  labs(title = "Weight Distribution (Continuous Variable)",
       x = "Weight (kg)", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()

print(weight_plot)
```

## Summary Statistics by Group

```{webr-r}
# Basic descriptive statistics by treatment group
treatment_summary <- measurement_demo %>%
  group_by(treatment_group) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean_age = round(mean(age_years), 1),
    mean_weight = round(mean(weight_kg), 1),
    mean_pain = round(mean(pain_rating), 1),
    .groups = 'drop'
  )

print(treatment_summary)
```
