# Interactive R Companion for SPSS Users

## Welcome to Your Learning Journey

This interactive companion helps you explore statistical concepts using R while following your SPSS-based statistics course. The materials are designed specifically for biostatistics and medical research applications.

## Companion, Not Substitute
This guide serves as a **learning companion** to your SPSS-based statistics course, not a replacement. While your primary instruction uses SPSS, this resource helps you explore how the same statistical concepts can be implemented in R.

## Why Learn R for Medical Research?

**Reproducibility**: R scripts document every step of your analysis, making your research completely reproducible. 

**Flexibility**: With thousands of packages available, R can handle virtually any statistical method needed for your research. 

**Open Source**: R is free and widely used in academic and clinical research settings.

## Getting Started with R

### Essential Setup

While this companion runs R directly in your browser, you may want to set up R on your computer for analysis projects: 

1. **Base R**: Download from [r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org/)
2. **RStudio**: Free desktop application from [rstudio.com](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/)


### Best Practices

**Documentation**: Use R Markdown (.Rmd) files to integrate code, results, and narrative of your thinking process. 

**Package Management**: Install packages once (**install.packages()**), load them each session (**library()**). This page will mainly use the `tidyverse` collection for easy data analysis workflows. 

Let's test that `webR` is working. Give it a try! Press the green play button and see your output. You can also make edits. 

```{webr-r}
# Test that webR is working
cat("Welcome to interactive R learning!\n")
cat("webR is ready for statistical analysis.\n")

# Quick demonstration
sample_data <- data.frame(
  patient = 1:5,
  age = c(45, 52, 38, 61, 49),
  treatment = c("A", "B", "A", "B", "A")
)

print(sample_data)
```

## Interactive Learning Features

### What Makes This Different?

- **Browser-based**: No software installation required
- **SPSS comparison**: Same datasets used for comparisons
- **Immediate feedback**: See results instantly as you learn

## Technical Setup

This companion uses:

- **webR**: R running directly in your browser
- **tidyverse**: Modern R packages for data analysis
- **Datasets**: Same datasets used in the class
