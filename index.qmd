# Interactive R Companion for SPSS Users

::: {.hero-banner}
## Welcome to Your Statistical Learning Journey

This interactive companion helps you explore statistical concepts using R while following your SPSS-based statistics course. Designed specifically for biostatistics and medical research applications.
:::

## Important Note: Learning Companion

::: {.callout-important}
## Companion, Not Substitute
This interactive guide serves as a **learning companion** to your SPSS-based statistics course, not a replacement. While your primary instruction uses SPSS, this resource helps you explore how the same statistical concepts and analyses can be implemented in R.

## Why Learn R for Medical Research?

R offers unique advantages for statistical analysis:

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-4}
### Reproducibility!!!
R scripts document every step of your analysis, making your research completely reproducible. Anyone can see exactly what you did and replicate your results.
:::

::: {.g-col-4}
### Flexibility  
With thousands of packages available, R can handle many statistical method or data visualization need in medical research.
:::

::: {.g-col-4}
### Open Source
R is free and widely used in academic, clinical, and pharmaceutical research settings.

## Quick Start Test

Let's verify everything is working correctly:

```{webr-r}
# Quick demonstration
sample_data <- data.frame(
  patient = 1:5,
  age = c(45, 52, 38, 61, 49),
  treatment = c("A", "B", "A", "B", "A")
)

print(sample_data)
```

## Course Sessions Overview

### [S01: Concepts of Measurement](s01.qmd) {#sec-s01-link}

::: {.callout-tip}
**Key Concept**: Variable type determines which statistical methods are valid.
:::

### [S02: Power Analysis and Sample Size](s02.qmd) {#sec-s02-link}

::: {.callout-tip}
**Key Concept**: Proper sample size planning prevents underpowered studies.
:::

### [S03: Descriptive Statistics](s03.qmd) {#sec-s03-link}

::: {.callout-tip}

**Key Concept**: Non-parametric tests for non-normal data or ordinal variables.
:::

### [S09: Chi-Square and Categorical Data Analysis](s09.qmd) {#sec-s09-link}

::: {.callout-tip}
**Key Concept**: Chi-square tests relationships between categorical variables.
:::

### [S10: Linear Regression and ANCOVA](s10.qmd) {#sec-s10-link}

::: {.callout-tip}
**Key Concept**: Regression models relationships while controlling for confounders.
:::

### [S11: Logistic Regression](s11.qmd) {#sec-s11-link}

::: {.callout-tip}
**Key Concept**: Logistic regression for binary outcomes (success/failure, disease/no disease).
:::

### [S12: Misc](s12.qmd) {#sec-s12-link}

::: {.callout-tip}
**Key Concept**: Miscellaneous.
