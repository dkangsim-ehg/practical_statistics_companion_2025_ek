## Companion, Not Substitute
This guide serves as a **learning companion** to your SPSS-based statistics course, not a replacement. While your primary instruction uses SPSS, this resource helps you explore how the same statistical concepts can be implemented in R.

## Why Learn R for Medical Research?

**Reproducibility**: R scripts document every step of your analysis, making your research completely reproducible.

**Flexibility**: With thousands of packages available, R can handle virtually any statistical method needed in medical research.

**Open Source**: R is free and widely used in academic and clinical research settings.

## Course Structure

### [Session 1: Concepts of Measurement](session1.qmd)
- Understanding different types of variables
- Measurement scales (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio)
- Data quality issues in medical research
- Practical examples with patient data

### [Session 3: Descriptive Statistics](session3.qmd)
- Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)
- Measures of variability (standard deviation, variance)
- Data visualization techniques
- Group comparisons and correlation analysis

## Getting Started

```{webr-r}
# Test that webR is working
cat("Welcome to interactive R learning!\n")
cat("webR is ready for statistical analysis.\n")

# Quick demonstration
sample_data <- data.frame(
  patient = 1:5,
  age = c(45, 52, 38, 61, 49),
  treatment = c("A", "B", "A", "B", "A")
)

print(sample_data)
```
